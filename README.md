# md2html
This is a ruby script that reads in a markdown file and converts it to html. The html that is generated is formatted for Google Sites' stylesheet.

At first this was a fork of (John's python script)[https://github.com/johnz2live/markdown-to-google-sites], but I prefer ruby, and so I scrapped it and rewrote it in ruby.

# Installing

1. `git clone git@github.com:jamesrz2live/markdown-to-google-sites.git`
2. `rake`
3. Enjoy
